# DynamicRangeCompressor

+ This patch contains an implementation of a dynamic range compressor based on the designs described here: [Digital Dynamic Range Compressor Design—A Tutorial and Analysis](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~josh/documents/2012/GiannoulisMassbergReiss-dynamicrangecompression-JAES2012.pdf).
+ I have not implemented a level detector yet, but the digital distortion can make guitars sound interesting (in my opinion).
+ There is a sample guitar file in the source directory. Drag and drop that into the patcher or load in your own audio input.
